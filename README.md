FieryGunHand
============

OpenGL-based Doom level renderer, for fun. Supports only original Doom format maps, that have been run through glBSP...

Uses OpenTK and .NET 4.5. Yes, I apparently made this in 2022...

Named after [Fiery Gun Hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7dt3gjPe4) by Cardiacs because it was in my Spotify Discover Weekly at the time.
